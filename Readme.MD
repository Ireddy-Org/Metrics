# The QUAD Metrics for Process Modelling

This Repository houses the QUAD metrics adapted for process modelling toolkit ProFIT.

The Metrics are: 

  **1. Replay Fitness**
  **2. Precision**
  **3. Generalization**
  **4. Simplicity**

By evaluating a Process model with these metrics, we can  obtain a balanced perspective on the Complexity & Understandability of the model.
