# The QUAD Metrics for Process Modelling

This Repository houses the QUAD metrics for process modelling toolkits ProFIT.

The Metrics are: 

  1. Replay Fitness
  2. Precision
  3. Generalization
  4. Simplicity

By evaluating a Process model with these metrics, we obtain a balanced perspective on the Complexity & Understandability of the model.
